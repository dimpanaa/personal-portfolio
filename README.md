## Quick Tips

1. **File names**: Use lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `v8-engine-model.md`)
2. **Order field**: Lower numbers appear first (1, 2, 3...)
3. **Preview changes**: Run `npm run dev` to see changes instantly
4. **Template files**: Files starting with `_` (like `_template.md`) are ignored
5. **Images**: Place images in `public/images/` and reference as `/images/filename.jpg`
