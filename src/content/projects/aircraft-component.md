In this project, I designed a small fixed-wing UAV in the 3 kg MTOW class, focusing on efficient lift generation and stable low-speed flight. The work was carried out as part of a UAV internship, where I applied theoretical concepts through hands-on design, simulation, and analysis tasks.

Key highlights:

- Completed formal training in UAV design, CFD, MATLAB, and avionics
- Performed wing and tail sizing based on lift and stability requirements
- Selected Clark Y and NACA 0012 airfoils for low-speed aerodynamic performance
- Set up CFD simulations to study external flow and lift–drag characteristics
- Developed MATLAB scripts for CL–CD plots and basic flight path simulation
- Actively contributed to technical discussions and collaborative project work
