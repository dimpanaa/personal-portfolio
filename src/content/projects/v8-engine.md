A comprehensive 3D model of a V8 engine created using SolidWorks. This project showcases detailed component modeling and assembly techniques, including working animations that demonstrate the engine's operation cycle.

Designed and fabricated a 3D-printed scale V8 engine model to demonstrate core engine architecture, component integration, and mechanical motion. The project emphasizes precision CAD modeling, kinematic relationships between moving parts, and design-for-additive-manufacturing principles, resulting in a functional, visually accurate mechanical system. elaborate this
