Designed a keychain-sized drink spiking detection device to address a widespread but underreported public safety issue affecting all genders. The device identifies tampered beverages within 60 seconds using a single drop of liquid and built-in disposable test strips.

I was responsible for the CAD design and mechanical layout, focusing on ergonomics, compactness, manufacturability, and discreet everyday use. The enclosure was optimized for low-cost production, durability, and ease of operation. The solution integrates with a mobile app for anonymous incident logging, medical guidance, and SOS alerts, enabling both personal safety and data-driven prevention.
